self.plot_graph.setBackground("w") # gackground color

    There are a number of colors available using single letters, as we did in the example above. 
    They're based on the standard colors used in Matplotlib. Here are the most common codes:
    Letter Code	Color
    "b"	Blue
    "c"	Cian
    "d"	Grey
    "g"	Green
    "k"	Black
    "m"	Magenta
    "r"	Red
    "w"	White
    "y"	Yellow

also 
    self.plot_graph.setBackground("#bbccaa")  # Hex
    self.plot_graph.setBackground((100, 50, 255))  # RGB each 0-255
    self.plot_graph.setBackground((100, 50, 255, 25))  # RGBA (A = alpha opacity)

We can also specify colors using Qt's QColor class if we prefer it:

    from PyQt5 import QtGui
    # ...

    self.plot_graph.setBackground(QtGui.QColor(100, 50, 254, 25))
